This is a few lines of code for I18N::Langinfo and POSIX module
functions returning and acting on Perl wide-char strings instead of
locale charset bytes.  It's good if you mostly use wide-char strings
in a program.

The replacement strftime() is particularly handy.  It accepts wide
chars in the format string, and converts the locale day/month names to
wide chars for the return.
